# workery-server
Backend for Workery application server implemented in Golang. This is a rewrite of the [``workery-django``](https://github.com/over55/workery-django) project.

## Development Goals:
1. Rewrite in Golang.
2. Rewrite to no longer use wildcards.
3. Rewrite to make simply (but less powerful) tenancy.
4. Rewrite with good [API documents](https://github.com/over55/workery-server/wiki).
5. Deploy on Ubuntu.
